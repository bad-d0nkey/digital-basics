## The Tale of the DIGH 4002 Essay

My favourite piece of academic work is my essay in Digital Culture and The Text I. It was a mighty and lovely project related to a corpus of William Gibson's seminal cyberpunk novels in the _[Sprawl Trilogy]_(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprawl_trilogy).

Below is a picture of William Gibson, the aforementioned author and the father of [cyberpunk](https://www.neondystopia.com/what-is-cyberpunk/).

> Also, if you want something more scholarly to read about cyberpunk, here is an article called ["Toward a Poetics of Cyberpunk"](toward-a-poetics-of-cyberpunk_mchale.pdf)

Back on point: well, the essay about Gibson's work was the plan. In reality: it was a project that went completely sideways and ended up being a documentation of a half dozen flops accomplished over four weeks of work. The essay narrated my work processes as I

+ tried a thing,
+ realised the thing didn't work,
+ realised it was even worse than that,
+ tried other things,
+ and repeated this process until I had enough narration to actually make an essay.

The last bullet was luck. I'd love to say I had the foresight to plan that, but, no, it was just dumb luck. I don't think I've ever been so stressed about an assignment or put so much work into something that was a non-thing ever before in my life.

## Why It Was cool

Well, I've had folks _say_ they're okay with failure, but that doesn't mean much when you're still being graded on the **quality** of your result (different schools being referenced here, not Carleton). That wasn't the case with this essay. It was actually my very cool Prof who suggested that I had, in fact, generated a _bona fide_ result as opposed to a non-result, as I had viewed it. Actually being allowed to take a risk instead of always performing in the present for _ze magical future_ (read: GPA protection for the if-maybe-perchance I get into a PhD program scenario) is what allows us to actually learn. Being given the room to do so is **_very cool_**.

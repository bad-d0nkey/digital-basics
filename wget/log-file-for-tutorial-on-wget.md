# what I was trying to do

i attempted the wget tutorial. to learn wget. 
okay, that's a lie. it's because i secretly want to terrorize the province of quebec and i've heard this is a good place to start. 

+ link to the tutorial: https://graddh.netlify.app/docs/tutorials/wget/
+ link to repo: like this: `[wget](https://github.com/bad-d0nkey/digital-basics/wget)`

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing

_describe; cross link to other research as appropriate_


## what I did

+ step 1  
	+ results
+ step 2
	+ results 
+ step 3
	+ results

_drop images, screenshots as relevant into the vault, link to them here. Use backticks to copy in relevant code snippets etc_

```
# example R code
data <- read.csv("data")
```

## challenges 

_error messages, unclear instructions, gaps in my knowledge, links to relevant asks for help on discord, stackoverflow posts, websites I went to for help_

_what can I do? who can I talk to? links to posts in discord, helpf fora, etc. links to other research projects etc_

# what I was trying to do

Was getting myself oriented in the command prompt/terminal environment. 

+ link to repo: `[command-line-for-pc](https://github.com/bad-d0nkey/digital-basics/tree/main/command-line-for-pc)`

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing

A lot of the text processing I've been learning of late takes place at the command line/terminal/whatever. I have no idea what I'm doing, which is not a lot of fun. Switching between GREP, (G)AWK, command prompt, bash, _whatever_ while also having foreign corpus annotation syntax thrown at you without knowing what they are, why those specific things would be chosen, what they do, or where in the computing environment I am sucks, to be blunt. 

Being able to orient myself in certain spaces and knowing how to navigate is very helpful. These sorts of tutorials (small scope, with "why" included) will help me build a foundation to put all the other random stuff atop. 

## what I did

+ step 1: ran through the YouTube video  
	+ I recognised these basics and practiced. It was good.

+ step 2: ran through the YouTube video  
	+ I recognised these basics more and practiced. It was good.

+ step 3: ran through the YouTube video  
	+ I recognised these basics even more and practiced. It was good.
	
+ step 4: read the transcript in the coursebook 
	+ accessed other resources. tried the colour themes thing but that's a no-go. the "very clear" instructions about how to change colours rely on a knowledge of json, which I do not have. will note that for later. moving on - the mantra as I progress through this course remains the same: build a base, keep the scope small, stay focused.
	+ but for future use, here is a theme to try to apply when i know more of the things

## challenges 

this exercise was fairly straightforward. i ran through it several times. i read the cheatsheet linked to in coursebook. i wrote notes. i did try to go one step beyond with the colour thing, but it turned out that was a separate skill. a challenge, but not directly related to command prompt 101 as i am focussed on.

## thoughts on where to go next

i am looking for lessons that actually explain the point of something and why you would want to do it and give some exercises with results. resources abound, but good ones that do what i'm looking for are less common. i can ask in discord if anyone knows of such a place. if not, it's back to the intertubes. 

come to think of it, if i could get to the point where i'm clear enough on what to do to work out what the hell is going on in the github-at-the-command-line thing (not to use it - to be able to recognise the pieces and the whys), that might be a good thing. but baby steps first!

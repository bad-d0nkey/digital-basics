# what I was trying to do

Was getting myself oriented in the command prompt/terminal environment. 

+ link to repo: `[command-line-for-pc](https://github.com/your-user-name/relevant-repo)`

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing

_describe; cross link to other research as appropriate_

## what I did

+ step 1  
	+ results
+ step 2
	+ results 
+ step 3
	+ results

_drop images, screenshots as relevant into the vault, link to them here. Use backticks to copy in relevant code snippets etc_

```
# example R code
data <- read.csv("data")
```

## challenges 

_error messages, unclear instructions, gaps in my knowledge, links to relevant asks for help on discord, stackoverflow posts, websites I went to for help_

## thoughts on where to go next

_what can I do? who can I talk to? links to posts in discord, helpf fora, etc. links to other research projects etc_

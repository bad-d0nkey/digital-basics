# what I was trying to do

Was getting myself oriented in the command prompt/terminal environment. 

+ link to repo: `[command-line-for-pc](https://github.com/bad-d0nkey/digital-basics/tree/main/command-line-for-pc)`
	+ it's not very exciting - it is just this note	

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing

A lot of the text processing I've been learning of late takes place at the command line/terminal/whatever. I have no idea what I'm doing, which is not a lot of fun. Switching between GREP, (G)AWK, command prompt, bash, _whatever_ while also having foreign corpus annotation syntax thrown at you without knowing what they are and/or how any of it relates to a "finite state transducer" **_(which, BTW, I am pretty sure is the thing that happend to Lt. Tom Paris when he became a guppy human and is not a thing that happens to a language)_**, why those specific things would be chosen, what they do, or where in the computing environment I am sucks, to be blunt. 

Being able to orient myself in certain spaces and knowing how to navigate is very helpful. One might go so far as to say "crucial to success". Yaknow? The underlying skills to entering weird-assed code for my purportedly entry-level computational linguistics class was being able to navigate the command line. Which I couldn't do... So these sorts of tutorials (small scope, with "why" included, and a place to hang the knowledge) in this class will help me build a foundation to put all the other random stuff atop.   

## what I did

+ step 1: ran through the YouTube video  
	+ I recognised these basics and practiced. It was good.

+ step 2: ran through the YouTube video  
	+ I recognised these basics more and practiced. It was good.

+ step 3: ran through the YouTube video  
	+ I recognised these basics even more and practiced. It was good.
	
+ step 4: read the transcript in the coursebook 
	+ accessed other resources. tried the colour themes thing but that's a no-go. the instructions about how to change colours rely on a knowledge of an additional skill, which I am not looking to develop right now. noted for later, but I'm staying focused on little things and moving on for now. 
	+ for the aforementioned future consideration, here is a theme to try to apply when i know more of the things - particularly what jason is, how to use it, and where

## challenges 

this exercise was fairly straightforward. i ran through it several times. i read the cheatsheet linked to in coursebook. i wrote notes. i did try to go one step beyond with the colour thing, but it turned out that was a separate skill. a challenge, but not directly related to command prompt 101 as i am focussed on. 

## thoughts on where to go next

i am looking for additional lessons that actually explain the point of something and why you would want to do it and give some exercises with results. resources abound, but good ones that do what i'm looking for are less common. i can ask in discord if anyone knows of such a place for additional command line stuff. if not, it's back to the intertubes - which may go better now that i understand a tiny bit more and can probably make use of a little more information. 

oh. come to think of it, if i could get to the point where i'm clear enough on what to do to work out what the hell is going on in the [github-at-the-command-line thing](https://github.com/bad-d0nkey/digital-basics/blob/main/github-basics/log-file-for-tutorial-on-github-basics.md.md) (not to use it, necessarily, but to be able to recognise the pieces and the whys), that might be a good thing that (a) shows progress, and (b) might turn out to be useful, though i'm not sure i'll ever co-code anything with someone like that.

*addendum: okay, i'm going to do the [github at the command line tutorial](https://graddh.netlify.app/docs/tutorials/github-cli/). not now. but i'm suspecting at some point during this course once this material has had some time to settle...

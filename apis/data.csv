In many respects, Mr. Grover is as un\nusual as some of the places he visits. A State Department\ncourier since 1946, he has traveled an estimated 2Vi million\nmiles through more than 100 different countries. Since\nserving as a photographer in the Navy during World War\n11, Mr. Grover has continued taking photos in his job—\nwhich primarily is the surveillance of diplomatic pouches\ncarrying classified documents from one U. S. post to an\nother. A professional writer, also, he has written many\narticles about couriers. He currently is preparing a history\nof the courier service from ancient times to the present\nand is planning to publish the ""Faraway Wonders” in book\nform. The courier service, he says, isn’t as romantic as TV\nplays and other mediums would have you believe. “But\nwe do have our moments,"" he says, ""most of them con\nnected with the normal hazards of travel."" In 1952, when\nMr. Grover was stationed in Cairo, rioters swept through\nthe city, pillaging and burning in a savage outburst aimed\nat the British. Acting fast under instructions from the\nState Department, he moved his office and 12-man staff\nto Athens. For this and other outstanding performances,\nhe was presented the department’s Meritorious Service\nAward.

But last\nnight, before a brilliant audience greeted by\nAugustoRooso. Italian Ambassador, Washing*\nton society listened with rapt attention to one\nof the most remarkable Ftories ever told of the\nlinking of archeology with the most practical\nsort of colonial expansion, based upon the\nphysical necessities of a growing people.\nImperial Rome is coming to life anew In the\nDark Continent. Out of the blazing African\nsands the genius of Premier Benito Mussolini\nend the tireless enthusiasm of Gov. Oen. italo\nBalbo, Italy's famed air marshal, are bringing\ncrops and inscriptions, olives, oil and classical\nmonument*. And the story was brought to\nWashington because a professor of Latin in\nCleveland asked the Archeological Society of\nWashington to sponsor a trip for him to the\nvast new-old colonial empire of Tripoli and\nCyrenaica, in Northern Africa.\nYears ago, when Π Duce was merely ""growing\nup"" as the rebuilder of Italy's war-shattered\nfortunes, he took a momentous oath to the\narmy of Blaclcshirts he was leading upon Rome.\nIt was a dramatic moment. Disillusioned and a\nprey to fears for the future of their country and\nthemselves, the war veterans were in a plastic\nmood. Anything could happen. So when this\nuntried leader stood forth to address them,\nmuch more than the fate of Italy hung upon\nbis words.\nPARIS, Berlin, London, Washington all lis\ntened. And not one of these capitals cor\nrectly interpreted the epoch-making words—\n""I swear to lead our country once more in the\npath of Its ancient greatness!"" The world\nthought it meant only another fantastic dream\nof conquest by arms until, as time passed and\nthe genuinely constructive pattern of Musso\nlini's policy began to declare itself visibly,\nworld tension lessened and hope was established\nIn the room of fear. What Mussolini meant by\nhis prophecy was far greater and more substan\ntial than any vision of armed conquest could\nbe. Guided and inspired by the history of\nRome's most brilliant period, he looked far into\nthe future and planned to bring back by peace\nful, constructive means a glory and a stability\neven greater than that of the Imperial City of\ncenturies ago, for his eye was set upon the pos\nsibilities of Africa, the idea of Italy as a self\nsustaining nation, and a Northern Africa fer\ntile, productive, alive where it has long been\ndead, and ministering not only to the material\nwants of a strong and lusty nation of develop\ning powers, but to its cultural and spiritual\nneeds as well. How this ideal has been launched\nsuccessfully and is already attracting the close\nattention of the other nations was the story\ngraphically presented through the courtesy of\nAmbassador Rosso and of the Italian officials\nIn Rome and Africa.\nToo little attention has been given right along\nsince Fascism has proved a force to be reck\noned with, to the fact that Mussolini has shown\nhimself to be the world's most acute student of\nhistory. Every one who has read Roman his\ntory with any degree of attention has a smat\ntering of the facts. But it remained for II Duce\nto perceive in those facts which others had\nread end failed to heed the solution of the\nproblems under which Italy of post-war days\nwas groaning. He alone realized that history is\nalways a continuing force, instead of a static\nthing of interest only. He knew that the buried\ncity of Leptis Magna, whose glories had been\nlost under waves of desert sands for ages, at one\ntime paid Rome a tribute of a million pounds\nof olive oil each year. He recalled that the poet\nHorace, when he wished to show how rich a\nman was in his epoch, wrote that the fellow\npossessed granaries in Libya. Could not Italy\ndivert the unemployment and discontent of\nthousands of its ardent subjects to these fertile\nfields which were merely waiting the enthusi\nastic cultivation of youth and energy? Would\nnot such endeavor repay many fold all the effort\nand anxiety required, by reclaiming the desert\nand assuring Italy food for her hungry chil\ndren for the years to come, and nourishing their\nsouls also by bringing back the buried monu\nments and records of former Roman greatness\nIn her colonies?\nThe thing was so obvious, so simple, so en\ntirely possible if the co-operation of the people\nJ ieu· of the native quarter of Tripoli from the castle.

The Ont steps were expensive. No\nIncome could be anticipated for a considerable\ntime. But the goal Justified the struggle, and\nItalian archeologiste began to dig Leptis Magna\nout oi the sands that centuries had piled above\nthis former metropolis. More archeologistt\nrame; more excavations were undertaken. Lit\ntle by little, not in & single city, but scattered\njudiciously through the Italian domain, emi\nnent scholars delved into the past. One of the\nmost interesting and appropriate inscriptions\nthey have dug up In Cyrene discloses the sig\nnificant fact that during the great famine in\nGreece, between the years 331 and 323 B.C.\nthis ancient ""African Athens"" exported some\n29,000 tons of cereals for the relief of the starv\ning Greek cities of Cyrene's motherland. Here,\nIndeed, as this inscription proves, were once\nfertile fields waiting only the plow and the seed\nand water to bring forth enough to make Italy\nIndependent and secure.\n\i/TTH such facts as these in mind. Dr.\n* ' Kenneth Scott, professor of Latin at West\nern Reserve University, and long an ardent\nstudent of Latinized Africa, went to Tripolitania\nand Cyrenaica last Spring and Summer. At\nthe request of the Archeological Society of\nWashington, Ambassador Rosso and many\nItalian scholars who are friends of the writer,\ngave Prof. Scott unexampled opportunities for\nthe most searching investigations and scrutiny\nin the rejuvenated colonial empire in Northern\nAfrica. It is a huge territory covering some\n350,000 square miles and embracing the ancient\nprovinces of Cyrenaica and Numidia as its\nmost Important region. Today Libia Itaiiana\nextends east and west between the 10th and\n25th parallels of longitude, and, crossing the\nTropic of Cancer, reaches south to about lat\nitude 23 degrees north. Appropriately enough,\nwhen the Italian archeologists began to exca\nvate the theater at Sabratha, a ruined city of\nancient times lying on the coast to the west\nof Lepti's Magna, they brought to light the\n—!\n""Tyche"" op Tort une"" of Sabratha clasptBf\nhands with the goddess Roma in the presence\nof Roman legionnaires. The scene represents\na peace pact between the mighty Italian capital\nand the African city. Its significance of friend\nship is perhaps even keener today than when^·\nthe relief was sculptured. Today it occupies a\nplace of honor in the governor general's palace.\nSetting this before his audience with the\nfullest detail, Prof. Scott emphasized the prac\ntical values archeology has had more than once\nIn Italian history, citing the dramatic moment,\nwhen, ""in the darkest depths of the Middle\nAges, Cola di Rienzo for a breathless moment\nresuscitated the lifeless corpse of Rome with\nhis magic appeal to the glorious past of the city\non the Tiber"" through revealing to the people\nthe ancient bronze tablet inscribed with the\nLex Imperio Vespasiano. He showed his audi\nence that the power to appoint emperors had\nrested with the Senate and the Roman people.\n""Then archeology had a ringing message, and\ntoday It brings again the same challenge,"" with\nthe monuments and other evidences of Rome's""*\nAfrican past as inspiration and stimulus to a\nrevived Italy in the guiding of the new Italian\nState. It is fortunate that in Gen. Balbo. the\nDuce has a lieutenant who is a most enthusias\ntic Latinist, a firm believer In th< destiny ot\nmodern Rome, and a man of boundless enthusi\nasms who Is administering his tremendous\nprovince in a spirit of liberalism which accords\nthe scientist a place of high honor. For Balbo\nhas made an astonishing practical use of the\ntreasures the archeologlsts have found.\nThe palace of the governor general of Trip\nolitania and Cyrenaica, the sprawling, irregular\nfortress-castle of ancient times guarding the\ncity of Tripoli, juts boldly out into the clea»\nemerald of the sea. It could hardly be bettered\nas an epitome of both the purpose and the\nexecution of Balbo's remarkable plan. The\npalace is famjliar to every schoolboy because\nof the depredations of the Barbary corsairs\nwho were severely mauled in 1815 by an Amer\nican squadron which blockaded the pirate den.\nThe city of Tripoli, perhaps the most pic\nturesque and attractive on the whole north\nAfrican Coast, lies between the vast orange\nhued sand dunes. All along the water front\nwave the ostrich-feather plumes of tufted\npalms, beneath which bloom incredible banks\nof brilliant flowers. As a setting for the official\nheadquarters of the new government, nothing\ncould be lovelier.

Pil\ngrims from the whole world have journeyed to\nthe scene of these happenings, some to view the\nactual site, the Mecca of Christianity; others\nto investigate the lore and tradition in which\nthe Holy Land is steeped.\nForemost among this latter class of pilgrims\nare those archeologists and learned men who\nhave concentrated their efforts on unearthing\nthe hidden secrets which will provide for\nmodem generations some idea of the ancient\ncivilizations which preceded the age of Christ\nand throw new light on the days of the\nprophets and apostles alike. This fascinating\nwork has been carried on at various times for\ncenturies, but it is only in comparatively\nrecent years that really important discoveries\nhave been made.\nOn tliis subject few men can talk with\ngreater authority than Dr. E. W. Masterman,\nwho has spent 20 years of his life in the Holy\nLand and has witnessed at first hand some of\nthe amazing discoveries made by the spade of\nthe excavator. In his office at the huge London\nHospital, which ministers to the sick and the\ndiseased of the East End districts of the great\nmetropolis, he told me the story of some of\nthese amazing finds which have led in certain\ncases to the confirmation of statements in the\nOld and New Testaments, and in others to the\nrational explanation of hitherto incompre\nhensible phenomena mentioned in biblical\ntradition\n11 TVER since the Crusades,” Dr. Masterman\nEZ said, ‘‘the civilized world has sought to\nsolve the mysteries which surround Palestine,\na country whose history is the history of the\nChristian religion, whose name of the Holy\nLand lends it a mythical glamour which attracts\nto its shores men of all nations and all creeds.\nArcheologists have made Palestine the object\nof painstaking and concentrated study, and the\nresults of some of the more important excava\ntory works that have been carried out there\nthrow new light on problems that have puzzled\nChristianity for thousands of years.\n‘“The work of archeologists in Palestine,” he\ncontinued, ‘‘is not carried on with the idea\nof completely solving one or two biblical\nallusions, or confirming or disproving facts, but\nwith the broader aim of enabling people of\ntoday to form an idea of the kind of civilization\nwhich existed in the time of the great Israel\nitish monarchies and the later Roman and\nHebrew dynasties to try to ascertain the kind\nof cities, houses and the modes and manner, of\neveryday life of the people of the time of Christ\nBind of preceding ages.\n“Incidentally, there arises the matter of solv\ning or at least seeking a reasonable solution of\nthose topographical and geographical problems\nwhich have perplexed students of the Bible\nfor centuries. Many of these remain obscure\neven today, despite the great work done by\narcheologists of the different nations. Here I\nmay mention that attracted to this great work\nhere have been representatives of all nations,\nboth Jew and Gentile, Catholic and Protestant,\nand even those professing no religion but re\ngarding the matter from a purely historic or\nscientific standpoint.\n""The United States has contributed as much\naa any country, and indeed more than most,\nto our present knowledge of the history of the\nland where Christianity was born, a knowledge\ncarefully and painstakingly garnered by scores\nof expeditions. In the case of all modern\nexpeditions full notes and plains have been\nmade, and these are continually being supple\nmented and increased by detailed contemporary\nobservations.\n'•For example, today Harvard University, the\nPalestine Exploration Fund, the Hebrew Uni\nversity in Jerusalem and the British School\nof Archeology in Jerusalem are allied in\nexcavating the remains of the once famous and\nImportant city of Samaria. The chief credit\nfor the organization of the expedition lies with\nProf. Lake of Harvard.\n“Many important finds have resulted. Twenty\nyears ago important excavations were carried\nout there by Prof. Reisner, but recent dis\ncoveries have carried the work forward a great\ndeal. This city dates back to the Israelite\nperiod, and the excavators have unearthed\nsufficient evidence to prove the magnificence\nand splendor of this mighty city of a bygone\nThe artist D. MoreUis conception of Salome being felicitated by her mother after being atearded the head of John the Baptist.\ncivilization. Palaces and churches and tombs\nof the early Christians have been brought to\nlight.\n11 TRACES of successive dynasties are not\nlacking, for Samaria had a checkered\nhistory. Prom the time of its capture by the\nAssyrians under Sargon about 722 B. C. to the\ncoming of Alexander the Great, nearly 400\nyears later, apparently it never ceased to be\nan important City. It was captured and de\nstroyed again in the second century B. C.,\nwith the result that evidences of its history\nabout that time are scarce, but during the\nRoman period it regained something of its\nformer glory.\n“After the destruction of the Roman city\na Christian community continued to live on\nthis spot and recently we discovered, near the\nruins of the palace of Herod the Great, the\nremains of a Christian church whose existence\nhad hitherto been entirely unsuspected. Prom\nthe evidence it appears to have been a church\ndedicated to John the Baptist and the de\ncapitated head of St. John was treasured with\nin its walls for many years as one of its\ngreatest possessions.\n“The shrine found there has been alluded\nto by early pilgrims to the Holy Land in the\ntwelfth, thirteenth and fifteenth centuries,\nwhose descriptions of the shrine enabled us to\nidentify it with the one found in this newly\ndiscovered church.\n“We discovered also a marvelous fresco\ndepicting the beheading of St. John the Baptist.\nInvestigation showed that this church had\nbeen rebuilt and renovated at various times\nby the Crusaders, by the Greeks and by the\nLatins.\n“According to tradition, the finding of the\nhead was made clandestinely in circumstances\nwhich, according to Prof. J. W. Crowfoot, are\nnot likely to have been commemorated until\nthe fame of the relic was noised abroad and\nits authenticity firmly established. Both archeo\nlogical evidences and literary tradition are\nvague as to the actual date of these happen\nings, but authoritative opinion places them\nsomewhere about the fifth century A. D.\n“These discoveries have confirmed in a very\nwonderful manner the mythical greatness of\nthe Israelitish monarchs; for instance, in the\nvindication of the character of Ahab, who.\naccording to biblical allusions, was something\nof a tyrant and always quarreling with the\nprophets. These records show him to have been\nindeed one of the greatest and most gracious\nof the Israelite kings.\n“In addition to the discoveries at Samaria,\nor Sebastia as it was called in later times,\nrecent excavations have brought to light much\nthat is new and confirmed ancient tradition\nconcerning the walled city of Jericho. These\nlatest efforts prove Jericho to have been a\nmighty city when the Israelites overthrew it\nand that it remained a deserted city for cen\nturies afterward.\n“The destruction of the city walls in the\nlate Bronze Age was followed by a great con\nflagration. The fire marks are plainly trace\nable in each home of the city that has been\nexamined. In some cases the charred debris\ndiscovered by the excavators was as much as\ntwo feet thick. We found burned beams and\npalm fiber thatch, apparently from the roofs.\nIt is clear, too, from all the evidence that the\ncity was burned while in active occupation,\nabout 1400 or 1500 B. C.\n“It should be remembered that the excava\ntions in Jericho were made possible by the\ngenerosity of two public-spirited men, Sir\nCharles Marston and the late Lord Melchett.\nWere it not for the lack of funds, which has\nalways been a handicap, much more important\nwork could be undertaken, and who knows with\nwhat astonishing results?”\nDR. MASTERMAN referred also to other\naspects of the work of exploration and\nexcavation in Palestine—-notably to the mag\nnificent accomplishments of that grand old\nman of Palestine archeology, Sir Flinders\nPetrie, whose unflagging efforts and tireless\nindustry have contributed so much to modern\nknowledge of the ancient civilization of the\nHoly Land.\nJust before his departure for Palestine, where\nhe is even now engaged in further excavatory\nwork, Sir Flinders Petrie described to me some\nof the more interesting features of his work.\nHe told how under the soil of one of the\nnumerous mounds, or small hills which break\nthe dull uniformity of the Southern Palestine\ndesert, he had found traces of successive civi\nlizations, each of which had erected a town\nor city cm the site, and each of which in turn\nhad vanished, leaving only a few ruined walls\nand tombs to mark the scene of its former\nsplendors.\n11 IVILIZATTONS,” Dr. Masterman observe^\n“come into being, they flourish for a\nwhile, then decline into inevitable decay. That\nis what archeology teaches us again and again.\nNone of them has survived, and even our\npresent civilization will one day follow the\nfootsteps of its predecessors and give place to\nsomething different. It is a fascinating hobby\nto speculate as to what our next civilization\nwill be like—perhaps a civilization from the\nEast where the world was cradled.’’\nOne of the most amazing features of Pales\ntinian exploration in recent years, however,\nhas been undoubtedly the explanation put\nforward by several authorities as to the marvels\nand miracles associated by tradition and bibli\ncal lore with the exodus of the Israelites from\nEgypt under the divinely inspired guidance of\ntheir leader, Moses.\nForty years ago Prof. Sayre of Oxford wrote:\n“The exact site of the ‘Mount of God’ must be\nleft for future explorers to discover.” Since\nthen many travelers and explorers have tried\nto locate the spot. Among them have been\nsoldiers, statesmen, archeologists and British\nsecret service agents.\nProminent among them was Dr. Alois Musil\nof Prague, but perhaps most famous among\nthose who have trodden these paths across the\ndesert to investigate the mystery of the “Mount\nof God” is the elusive Lawrence of Arabia,\nwhose work during the war took him over this\nterritory. He was followed by certain officers\nof the British Army whose duties have in post\nwar years been the maintenance of law and\norder in these areas. More recently the Rev.\nW. J. Phythian Adams. M. A.. D. S. O., M. C,\nhas contributed the weight of his authority\non this subject.\nBroadly speaking, the theory now gaining\nground is that the miraculous happenings\nwhich befell the fleeing Israelites may be\nexplained by the geographical features of the\nland.\n(Copyright. 1932.1\n^ A sane of Jericho as it stands today.

DAVIS.\nINGERPRINT science has a new role—>\nhelping archeologists to solve mysteries\nIt appears that potters shaping their\nclay in a Bible town, in the days of\nSamuel and Saul and on down to the\ntime of Christ, left fingerprints on their wares.\nThe potters died. The Bible town fell into\nruins. The broken lamps and pitchers, stUl\nfinger-marked, lay buried in debris.\nAnd now. several thousand years later, these\nfingerprints, newly discovered, are plain enough\nfor an archeologist to use them as dependable\nclues In reconstructing the town's history.\nThus, at last, archeology has succeeded In\nforcing fingerprint science to do its well known\nkind of detective work on mysteries of the past.\nFor some time it has been hoped that cele\nbrated masters of Greek vase painting could be\nidentified by their prints. There are finger\nmarks on some of the vases by unknown Oreeks.\nWhat is sought is a fingerprint on ft signed\nvase. That could—with luck—be matched with\nprints on some of the unsigned vases. But so\nfar that quest has proved unsuccessful. All the\nprints on the puzzle-vases have been discour\nftgtngly different.\nSuccess in adapting fingerprint methods to\nBible explorations will renew the faith of arché\nologie ts that modern fingerprint science can\nidentify the ancient dead. Possibilities In this\nfield may be far-reaching, for soft clay natural\nly catches finger imprints, and clay was the\nmain stuff of which the ancient world was\nmade.\nOut of lumps of pliable clay, the ancients\nmanufactured not only household dishes, but\nimages of Astarte and Baal, art vases, tablets\non which to write, and many of their houses\nand walls. There Is detective work ahead there\nfor scientists with microscopes and training In\nanalysis of fingerprint patterns.\nTHE Bible town which has yielded the first\nimportant fingerprint data is Mlzpah, fa\nmous for its associations with many Bible char\nacters.\nSince 1·2β, this lont-buried town has been\nIn Bible ruins.\nthe scene of repeated scientific encampments.\nArab workers move about on the high mound,\nshoveling away earth, clearing city walls, carry\ning basket loads of archeological evidence down\nto the expedition offices below.\nThe leader of these excavations, which have\nJust entered upon their fifth season, Is Dr. Wil\nliam P.

The\nawestruck spies said the cities were ""walled up\nto heaven."" Just a frightened exaggeration?\nWell, Prof. Bade found the wall of Mlzpah. and\nthat wall haa caused biblical scholars to revise\ntheir respectful opinions of Canaanlte building\nprowess.\nMlzpah's wall, unearthed, stands over 1β\nfeet thick and 20 feet high. When the Israelites\ncame to conquer Palestine, the wall must have\nstood full 40 feet high. Nevertheless, the Israel\nites took Mlzpah.\nAt Mlzpah, later, Samuel sat by the great gate\nand acted as Judge over the people. Prof. Bade's\nexpedition found this gate, the finest that has\nbeen discovered in Palestine.\nAt Mlzpah, Saul was chosen king by the cast\ning of sacred lots. The excavations have un\nearthed foundations of a large building, which\nmay well have been the temple where Saul\nwas crowned.\nAt Mlzpah later occurred a political murder\nwhen Oedaliah, a new and unsuspicious gover\nnor, invited Ishmael and his friends to a ban\nquet, though Oedaliah bad been warned that\nIshmael was his enemy. The banquet ended in\nan uprising and Oedaliah and other victims\nwere slain. Thirty bodies were cast Into a cis\ntern, there at Mlzpah. Prof. Bade's explorations\nrevealed a cistern mysteriously sealed over,\nwhich seems to be this ancient tale of political\nintrigue.\n|AR handles stamped with letters MZP have\n^ been found, helping to verify the site as\nMlzpah of Bible fame; also an agate seal bear·\nι Ing the significant words, ""Belonging to Jaaza\nnlah, servant of the king."" Capt. Jaazaniah,\naccording to Bible verses, went to Mlzpah to\noffer fealty to the governor there.\nThrough all these discoveries the excavators\nhave industriously collected a great many pot\ntery objects, brokeq and whole, used by people\nof Mlzpah In three or four thousand years οt\nancient history. One season the workmen car\nried basket· of pottery from tombs, wells and\ntrash deposits.\nProf. Bade le alert to the value of modern\naids in rediscovering the Bible world. That\nthere was a settlement on the mound, long\nago, he first deduced when he climbed the hill\nand saw broken chips of pottery lying among\nthe wheat and barley on the tilled surface.\nBefore he decided to dig, however, he sought\nevidence of the wall that would have sur\nrounded a city of Importance.\nFor this he needed a good airplane photo\ngraph, which might show, even under a blanket\nof earth, the faint shape of a once prominent\nwall. The German government came to his\naid with an enlargement of an aerial photo\ngraph showing environs of Jerusalem. Satisfied\nthat there was Indeed a wall. Prof. Bade set his\nmen to work and within half an hour the\ncorner tower of the wall of Mizpah bad been\nstruck.\nThey had not been digging long when the\narcheologlst began to wonder about finger\nprints. There were a good many prints on the\nclay lamps, jugs and bowls. Prof. Bade set aside\nthe ancient fingerprint records. He was re\nsolved to study them when he got away from\nthe crowded, busy days of digging.\nBack In his laboratory in Berkeley, he called\non August Vollmer, professor of police admin\nistration at the University of California and\nformer police chief of Berkeley.\nw ""It Is no reflection on the character of\nmembers of the venerable company of ancient\npotters to say that we are taking their finger·\nprints with the aid of the criminal Identification\nbureau of a California city.""\nBible scholar and criminologist, working to\ngether, sorted out two kinds of prints in the\nclay evidence before them.\nOn large, two-handled Jars, the potters of\nMizpah had sometimes deliberately left thumb\nand fingerprints on the Jar handles. The pot\nters, who by the way were probably women,\ndid this as a trademaark, Prof. Bade concludes.\nGood workmen of every age have been eager\nto mark their own products.\nThe other type of print looks unintentional.\nThis type of mark occurs scattered over the sur\nface of bowls and other objects, as If the finger\nmarks had come there In the shaping of the\nclay.\nBy comparing fingerprints, Prof. Bade and\nProf. VoUmer have been able In many instance·\nto identify the work of the same potter.\nThe debris of a town like Mizpah lies in\nlayers buried by successive builders. In Bible\nGedaliah, the governor,\ninvited Ishmael and hi»\nfriends to a banquet, al\nthough Gedaliah had been\nwarned that Ishmael tvas his enemy.\nThe banquet ended in an uprising.and\nGedaliah and other victims were slain.\ndays each new set of inhabitants, after a fire,\nwar or other calamity, would level off the\nwreckage and build their new homes over the\nruins.\nThis fllling-in and levellng-off process often\ndisturbed the lower layers of burled history.\nProf. Bade explains. For that reason, ar\nchéologie ts have trouble tracing the same layer\nof occupation over a 12-acre site such as Mix\npah represents. And that means doubt and\nmuch argument over the age and interpret»·\ntion of the historic features of the site.\nWhen clay Jara found in different parts «β\nthe mound bear the unmistakable finger marks\nof the same person, that is good evidence foe\nsettling arguments. Clay pitchers were fragile\n■tuff. They broke easily, got lost down well*,\nand in general lasted no longer than our own\neveryday breakfast sets. 80 the finger mark·\nof an Israelite potter on her work, wherever\nIt turns up, show that those parts of the mound\nbelong to the same era of city history.\nFarmers Get Break\nTHE fermera bave gotten s good break an\n' around In the past two years.

Al\nthough he hadn’t make a stake at\nmining, he decided that this coun\ntry had the “something” he was\nlooking for.\nThat winter he took two mining\nshort courses at the College and\naudited a course in geology. Geist\nand Dr. Bunnell got acquainted\nand talked archeology.\nOtto’s Alaskan career was spark\n\ ed by a small collection of Eskimo\nartifacts which the College had\nobtained Jrom the late Alaskan\nhistorian Clarence L. Andrews.\nPresident Bunnell, in showing this\ncollection to Geist, remarked, “It\nwould be nice if we had a museum\n* . .* ’4\nDON'T BE A SHIRKER. ..\nWhen your community repre\nsentative asks your coopera\ntion in civilian defense\nduties, do your duty.\nf f •'1 ■ -\nand someone Jo do the work.”\nThat was seed enough for Otto.\nIn the summer ahd fall of 1926 he\nmade a complete reconnaissance\nof the Bering Sea coast—St. Mi\nchael, the Cape Nome country,\nWales, Big and Little Diomede,\nKing Island, St. Lawrence, the\n| Pribilofs, Unalaska, villages along\nthe Alaska Peninsula and parts of\nKodiak Island. He visited many\nlocations of midden sites, and vil\nlages of former ages. He bought\nmany native artifacts, and became\nconvinced that the Eskimo coast\nheld unlimited opportunity for\nstudy.\nThe Motcrrship Boxer, on whioh\n' Geist was traveling deposited him\n* and his collection in Ketchikan.\nOtto spent the winter with his\n; brother. In the spring, Dr. Bunnell\nI came through Ketchikan en route\nI to the College, and saw the arti- j\nfacts Geist had gathered. “We\nshould have these for the Univers- ;\nity,” Dr. Bunnell exclaimed. “Some '\nof them are unlike any I have j\nseen before.”\nThe upshot of this conversation\nwas that the College had the be\nginnings of a museum, and Dr. j\nBunnell put up $1000 of his own j\nmoney to finance the “Bunnell- j\nGeist Bering Sea Expeditions of\n1927-28-29.”\nGeist returned on the Boxer and j\nbecame virtually a resident of St. j\nLawrence Island.\nBy the fall of 1929 Dr. Bunnell j\nwas successful in obtaining funds |\nfor continued research in. Eskimo-'\nology. Otto took a year out to do;\nmore studying in his chosen field,\nthen in 1931 returned to St. Law\nrence Island and the greatest dis\ncovery of his career.\nThis “find” was the ancient vil\nlage of Kukulik — the ibiggest j\nmound in Alaska at that time. This\nmound turned up more original\nmaterial on Eskimo life and cul-,\ni\nture than any previous discovery\nanywhere.\nDuring the mid-thirties $30,000\nfrom the PWA put the St. Law\nrence Island expedition on its fi\nnancial feet. Eight University of\nAlaska students assisted Otto as\nsupervisors, and 56 natives were\nengaged as diggers and collectors.\nAmong the University students\nwere Ivar Skarland and Mary Mi\nkami, both of whom received their\nDoctor’s Degrees in the subject.\nThe results of this expedition\nare described in “Archaeological\nExcavations at Kukulik” by Otto\n| William Geist and Forelich G.\nRainey. This book may be pur\nchased from the University of\n| Alaska bookstore and from the Su\nperintendent of Documents, Wash\nington, D. C.\nPearl Harbor Day found Otto\nGeist enroute to New York City to\nspend the winter working in the\nAmerican Museum of Natural\nHistory. Not many days later saw\nMr. Geist enroute back to the Ter\nritory to work for the Army En\ngineers.\nAll Bering Sea residents will re\nmember Major Otto Geist, who\nwas quartermaster of the Alaska\nTerritorial Guard during the latter\ndays of World War II. Major Geist\nknew how to work with Eskimos.\nDuring his Excavation days he had\nbeen “adopted” by the Eskimos of\nSt. Lawrence Island, and given\nthe name of “Whale.” This symbol\nis tattooed on his left arm.\nAfter the war, Geist returned to\nthe University of Alaska and his\nlife revolved around the discovery\nand classification of “bones.” He\nis considered THE collector of fos\nsils in the Territory. Although he\nworks alone most of the time, and\nseemingly in a small orbit, he is\nknown and respected wherever\nscientists meet throughout the\nworld. He is a member of more\nthan a dozen organizations dedi\ncated to the advancement of hu\nDISTRICT LAND OFFICE\nInformation Necessary for Obtain\ning a Coal Prospectin Permit:\nA Coal Prospecting Permit can\nbe obtained by: Any citizen of\nUnited States twenty-one years or\nmore; Corporation or municipality\norganized under the laws of the\nUnited States, any state of terri\ntory.

After 27 years in the Ter\nritory, most of which time has\nbeen devoted to archeology and\npaleontology, Geist says, “There is\nso much to learn, and time flies by\nso swiftly.”\nI JACK LENCER I\nI WATCHMAKER . 1\n| Leave watches at the Nome Drug Store |\nI Box 625 Nome, Alaska |\nOH, DIANA! • THE MISS THAT’S A HIT\nMO/ DAO— DIMMER\nISM'T\nIffl * ■\nI tfNMi/Mva\n\0*Su^sKumm\n.••XT'S VOUR SHIRT \ ~~\nX e>URI^EC>..- ) /a- a\n~rn 7""\nSCORCHY SMITH ACE OF THE AIR STRIPS\ni\nLOOKOUT\nTHERE/THflt THE\nMEDITERRANEAN /\nI I\nI\nSOMEWHERE/T\nTHERE'S A LOT OF\nOIL IN THAT--'\nWATER.'

Merrifield of the\nMerrifield copper millions, was a\nman who had reached the matur\nity of 23 years.\nHe himself knew it to be mature\nbecause wider all legal and moral\nconcepts age 21 makes a man\ngrown, and he was two years past\nthat. Time was when he used to\ndo frivolous things, youthful things.\nOne is to be excused for such\nlapses, due to one’s youth. A ma\nture man, of course, must give\nhimself to serious endeavor.\nJeremy had learned to be seri\nous away back in high school. A\nrelatively slender physique which\nkept him out of most sports, one\neye which tended to drift slantwise\nand required heavy spectacles, and\nparents who were determined to\nmake him a “man of brains” had\nall been responsible. Books, whole\nlibraries of them, had been placed\nin Jeremy’s path since before he\ncould remember. That there is a\nworld apart in books, everybody\nknows. Jeremy discovered it early.\nHe moved from the sheer enter\ntainment value of books as a high\nschool freshman, discovering their\nmore meaty worth, and by the\ntime he was a freshman in college\nhe was a kind of walking savant\nthat belied his actual years.\nFor instance, Jeremy knew more\nabout such things as philosophy\nthan he did about—well, about\ngirls.\n“The transcendentalism of Kant\ntends to affirm the existence of a\npriori principles of cognition,” Jer\nemy had said only last evening, in\na happen-so discussion during the\notherwise gay party. Several of the\ngirls heard him, but they didn’t\nanswer, except for little Tempe\nHyde.\n“OOooooo!” she sounded off, im\npressed.\nJeremy naa looxea at ner tnen,\nconscious of her appreciation. It is\ngood to be appreciated. Before the\nevening was over he had told her\nquite a bit about transcendental\nism, and he had told Gayle Dixon\nquite a bit more about archeology.\nGayle was really more responsive\nthan the smaller girl, he had found.\nGayle had—well, poise, and intel\nlectuality. Tempe seemed to think\nthat “OOooooo” was sufficient con\nribution to almost any discussion,\nwhich of course was erroneous.\n* Gayle had come right out and\nsaid, “Jeremy, exactly what is\narcheology, arid why does it fasci\nnate an intelligent man such as\nyou?”\nNow that was all right. Jeremy\nset in to answer her. It took him\nabout half an hour to do so.' It\nwas the most talking he had done\nto a pretty girl since—well, let’s\nsee—probably ever. Of course he\ndidn’t classify that as ""talking to\na girl”; it was a discussion of his\nwork intelligently when opportuni\nty presents.\nThat’s what scholars are for.\nScolarliness .defeats its own high\npurpose unless it is shared with\nhumanity; any true scholar is in\nherently unselfish with his knowl\nedge. It is a code of the intelli\ngentsia everywhere, Jeremy re\nminded himself that night in bed.\npe wished he had explained trans\ncendentalism to Gayle, too.\nThis morning, after the party, it\noccurred to him that he must find\ntime to be agreeable to the Miss\nDixon and Mr. Bailey whom his\ngrandfather had hired to manage\na new Little Theater project for\nthis city. Sponsorship of the drama\nwas a noble enterprise, of course,\neven though not directly related to\narcheology or philosophy.\n“It might even be said,” Jeremy\nhad mentioned in discussing it\nwith Mr. Weems at breakfast,\n“that the drama represents the\nhighest form of art, because the\nideal drama re-creates human\nlives. Shakespearian analysts will\nagree to that. Music, of course, has\ninfinite esthetic power, but I would\nrate the drama even higher, would\nyou not, Mr. Weems?”\n“Oh, of course, sir,” Mr. Weems\nnodded. The elderly secretary\nstood somewhat in awe of this\nbookish young man. The two had\nbeen served breakfast together fre\nquently since Jeremy’s arrival in\nthe Merrifield mansion a couple of\nweeks ago, Mr. Weems feeling it\nessential that someone act as host\nfor the young man. Mr. Merrifield\nhimself was a little more cold\nabout it.\nStudy into the vast and no doubt\nfascinating field of pre-history in\nYucatan was to have occupied Jer\nemy all of this morning. He had\nbeen unable to concentrate,\nthough, and so had come down\nstairs—to enter the conservatory\nabruptly and come bang onto Bill\nBailey holding pretty Gayle in his\narms and kissing her.\nHis shock had been no greater\nthan theirs. But Bill’s recovery\nwas quickest. He moved away\nfrom Gayle rather hastily.\n“Ha, ha—hi, there, Jeremy—ha,\nha!” He sounded rather silly, ne\nknew, and he saw that Gayle was\ncrimson. He went on, with elabo\nrate casualness. “Rehearsing a\npart, Jeremy, for the new play.\nBeen at it all morning. Gayle's try\ning out for the feminine lead.\nYeah.”\n“Interesting,” Jeremy nodded,\nthawing a little, and being polite.\n“Yeah, sure is. Whew! Warm in\nhere.” It wasn’t warm in here, or\nat least Jeremy couldn’t feel it,\nbut no doubt Bill had been working\nhard. Jeremy saw that Gayle was\nsuddenly concerned with reading\nher script.\n“What is the play you expect to\npresent first, Mr. Bailey?”\n“Oh, just call me Bill! Every\nbody else does. The play is a\nhoney, really. A springtime com\nedy called ‘Maid to Measure.’\nThree acts. Brilliantly written. ’\n‘“Maid to Measure.’ Regret to\nsay I am not familiar with it,”\nJeremy said. “But then, I know\nrelatively little of contemporary\ndrama. You will act in it, then, as\nwell as direct?”\n“Yeah. We’re short of male\nchara — SAY!” Bill suddenly\nsnapped his fingers, seemed to dis\ncover that Jeremy was standing\nthere. “Listen to me, Jeremy,\ndidn’t you know you were sup\nposed to be in this play yourself?”\n“Why—why, no!”\nGayle looked up. Nobody else\nhad thought of that until now,\nreally; but the idea was sound.\n“Sure you are! Come right up\nhere, young man. I’ll put you\nthrough that same part and see\nwhat sort of actor you’ll make.\nNow look, the script reads that you\nand the heroine are—”\nThe explanation was rapid, and\nso forceful that Jeremy could get\nin no protest at all. Nobody could\nescape Bill Eailey, as a matter ot\nfact, when that ebullient young\nman’s verve was going. He was\nquite irresistible, and his enthusi\nasm was contagious to a degree.\nJeremy found himself actually up\non the stage, however astonishing\nthat fact was to him.\nJeremy cleared his throat and\nspoke positively. “It is imperative\nthat I say I have never acted in\nany sort of dramatic presentation.\nEven though this is, as I under\nstand, to be a so-called amateur\nproduction, it would seem that\nsome experience—”\n“Goody, you can start from\n(Continued on Page Eleven)\n■ --\nTHIS CURIOUS WORLD |\n■\nMOST REPTILES LAV THEIR\nEses ONI Z.AAO.. > 33\n. ..WHILE AVDST\nAMPHIBIANS\nLAV THEIRS IN\nNUMEROUS\nARCTIC INSECTS\nCONTINUE ACTIVE\nLIVING AT\nTEMPERATURES\nWELL BELOW THE\nFREEZING POINT.\nt . .\nIM WHOSE HONOR.

I was\nsomething I had done or some\nthing Ihad not done who in\nthunder can -tell aboufa woman ?\nand I was penitent as' any Mecca-bound\nMoslem. She sat stiff\nand straighten the half-gloom of\nthe crowded wagonette, and\nwould not even talk of the\nweather. For my part, I whistled\nthe Viennese waltz she had al\nways loved, in the hope of making\nher sigh. Then I whistled the\n""Saffron Sue"" air which she 'de\ntested, in the hope of rriaking her\nrage. But Annette sal stiff and\nstraight and cold like the statue\nof Juho in the art gallery.\nI stood that kind-of thing as\nlong as any man who is not a\nShoshone Indian or a Grecian\narcheology professor could stand\nit; then I reached for Annette's\nlittle, pinkish hand. She moyed\nit slightly, slowly backward. I\nfollowed up the beautiful member\narid- pressed three fingers close in\nmy big, rough palm. There was\nno answering pressure, but An\n'nette did not withdraw her hand,\nand she turned her fluffy,' straw\ncolored coiffure halfway toward\nme.\nm and Annette sighed at last.\nThe girl to the left of me fidget\ned about, and Bobby Gates across\nthe way told a boisterous story.\nIt all .threw the heart-chords out\nof tune for a-moment, so that An\nnette moved slightly away. I\nbad been too sudden you have\no handle Annette like a dyddite\nshell. I drew back myself and ad\ndressed a remark to the driver""\nabout the worms getting Jhe to-\nbacco crop. Then Annette slid\nback toward me, arid there was\njust enough light to see the small\nhand assiime its old position\n. ""Sweet I whispereoV'don't\nmove away again. ""The very,\ntingle of your hand thrills me like\nan Edison battery, and I love you\nforever."" , ,\nShe jerked suddenly away then,\nand I could see that she was try\ning to read my face in the gloom.\nThe girl at my left squirmed\nabout like a diamond-back rat\ntler.' The driver turned and ask\ned if I wanted to buy a good 3-year-ojd\ngray mule. But I burn\ned with love for Annette, and\nwould not ""be denied. I reached\nand drew her toward me. Some\nhow she seemed to give in all a\nonce and snuggle close it was\never Annette's dear way.\n""Do you reaHy mean it, Dick?""\nshe whispered.\n""Wait until we get home and\nI'll make affidavit,"" I assured her. v\n""I am going to kiss you.\n""Oh!"" she cried sdftly, so that\nthe girl at my left started. ""Oh,""\ncontinued Annette, ""some prying\nwretch would see you !""\n""Love is the greatest thing in\nworld, but it is invisible,"" I par\nried. ""But they would hear'"" de\nmurred Annette.\n""None of these paltry creatures\nis attuned to such a pitch that he\ncould catch the vibrations of sen\ntiment,"" I answered.

Today, its authenticity still is dis\nputed, though there is a tendency toward belief that it is\nreal. The inscriptions on the face and one edge are reputed\nby some authorities to be in 14th century runic characters,\nrecording the presence of Scandinavian explorers in Minnesota\nin 1362. The most acceptable literal translation is: “8 Goths\n(Swedes) and 22 Norwegians on exploration journey from\nVinland westward. We had camp by two skerries one day’s\njourney from this stone. We were and fish ted) one day.\nAfter we came home (we) found 10 (of our) men red with\nblood and dead. A. V. M. (Ave Virgo Maria) save (us) from\nevil. (We) have 10 men by the sea to look after our ship(s)\n14 days’ journey from this island. Year 1362.”\nGROUPED AROUND the original stone in the National Museum, where it was on\ndisplay, ore Dr. Waldo R.
